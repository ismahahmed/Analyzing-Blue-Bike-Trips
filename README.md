# Analysis of Boston Blue Bikes Data in 2019

Data for this project can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/bluebikes-in-boston). 

## Introduction
### Data Origin and Overview
Blue Bikes, formerly known as Hubway, is a public bike-sharing system across the metropolitan areas of Boston. Participating individuals can either be Blue Bike members (including annual or monthly members) or casual single-trip day pass users. Blue Bikes publishes downloadable files of trip user data each quarter, and for this analysis, I will be using the compiled 2019 dataset from Kaggle in addition to the station dataset published by Blue Bikes.

The data set from Kaggle was originally retrieved from Blue Bikes and then compiled and collected for the year 2019. Blue Bikes also publishes downloadable files of station data, I will be joining the 2019 trip data from Kaggle with the station data to analyze municipality data. Both datasets used in this analysis was downloaded as CSV files and read as a dataframe in R.
